    <USH_Necroa.description>An infection of unstable Grey Mechanites contracted from a Grey Corpse. As these mechanites have already performed their duties in breaking down a previous host for valuable organic matter they lack the stability and power of regular Grey Goo mechanites and are now only capable of turning the infected host into a Grey Corpse, rather than a drone, or a standard infection.</USH_Necroa.description>
