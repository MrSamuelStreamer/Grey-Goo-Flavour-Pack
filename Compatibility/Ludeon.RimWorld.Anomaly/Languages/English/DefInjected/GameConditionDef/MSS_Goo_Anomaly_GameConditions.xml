    <DeathPall.description>A cloud of grey mechanites have descended on the area, permeating and penetrating into all organic cells.\n\nThe mechanites will enter corpses which will undergo pseudo-animation as they are broken down by the Grey Mechanites over several days. Any preexisting and newly resurrected Grey Corpses will be driven by new programming to spread the grey goo further, and will attack all living creatures.\n\nBurn, bury, destroy, or move corpses indoors to prevent them from being affected.</DeathPall.description>
